# Introduction
The purpose of this project was to develop a website that would serve as a platform for the organization to showcase its mission, history, events, and ways for visitors to get involved. As part of the project, I used Wordpress to create a custom theme and used Elementor and Contact Forms to create a visually appealing and user-friendly website.

#Features
The website features six main sections:
- Home: The landing page of the website, which showcases the organization's mission and highlights its latest news and events.
- About: A page that provides an overview of the organization's history and mission, as well as its core values and objectives.
- History: A page that highlights the organization's journey and achievements over the years.
- Events: A page that showcases the upcoming events organized by the organization and allows visitors to register.
- Help: A page that provides information on how visitors can help and support the organization, including ways to donate, volunteer, or become a partner.
- Contact: A page that provides visitors with an easy way to get in touch with the organization by filling out a contact form.

# Technologies Used
The website was developed using the following technologies:

- Wordpress: A popular content management system that powers millions of websites worldwide.
- Elementor: A powerful page builder plugin for Wordpress that allows for easy customization of website pages.
- Contact Forms: A Wordpress plugin that enables the creation of custom contact forms for visitors to reach out to the organization.

# Value of my Work
This project allowed me to develop my skills in web development, particularly in Wordpress and Elementor. By working on this project, I gained hands-on experience in creating custom themes and implementing various Wordpress plugins to achieve the desired functionality. I also learned how to collaborate with other members of the team, receive feedback and suggestions, and implement changes based on those suggestions. Overall, this project has helped me develop my skills and knowledge in web development and prepared me for future projects in this field.
